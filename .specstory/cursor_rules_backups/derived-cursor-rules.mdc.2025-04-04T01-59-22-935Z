## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a WordPress website, confirmed by the directory structure (specifically `app/public/wp-admin`, `app/public/wp-content`, `app/public/wp-includes`) and the presence of a database dump (`app/sql/local.sql`). The project uses a Local by Flywheel or Local WP directory structure, a common local WordPress development environment.  Files `.wpe-pull-ignore` and `.wpe-push-ignore` suggest potential deployment to WP Engine hosting.  No `package.json` was found, indicating it is not a Node.js based project. The `conf` directory contains configuration files for MySQL, Nginx, and PHP.
