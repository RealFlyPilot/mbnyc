## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project appears to be a WordPress installation, based on the directory structure observed in the `app` directory.  The project uses a standard WordPress folder organization (`app/public/wp-admin`, `app/public/wp-content`, `app/public/wp-includes`). No `package.json` was found, indicating it may not be a Node.js based project.  The `conf` directory suggests configuration files for various services (MySQL, Nginx, PHP). A database dump (`app/sql/local.sql`) is also present.
