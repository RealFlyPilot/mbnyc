Let me also check the style.css file:

---

---

Let me check the contents of these CSS files to understand the styling structure.

---

Read file: app/public/wp-content/themes/hello-elementor-child/assets/css/variables.css

---

Let me check the main.css file as well.

---

Read file: app/public/wp-content/themes/hello-elementor-child/assets/css/main.css

---

The theme has a well-organized CSS structure:

1. Base Styles:
- Uses CSS variables from variables.css
- Sets foundational typography and colors
- Responsive base font sizing

2. Component Styles:
- Typography: Consistent heading styles
- Links: Clean hover states
- Buttons: Modern styling with transitions
- Container: Responsive max-width layout
- Grid: Simple grid system using CSS Grid

3. Utility Classes:
- Text alignment
- Margin utilities (top/bottom)
- Padding utilities
- All using consistent spacing variables

Let me check if there are any other CSS files or styling-related configurations.

Let me help you explore and understand the codebase further. First, I'll check what files we have in the workspace.

</details>

---

I see this is a WordPress project with deployment scripts and configuration. Let me check the `app` directory since that's likely where the theme code is located.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |

Let me check the public directory to find the theme files.

Let me check the wp-content/themes directory to find the Hello Elementor child theme.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/public/wp-content/themes • **2** results</summary>

| 📁 `hello-elementor` |

</details>

---

Now let me check the contents of the child theme directory.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/public/wp-content/themes/hello-elementor-child • **7** results</summary>

</details>

---

Let me check the assets directory to see what it contains.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/public/wp-content/themes/hello-elementor-child/assets • **1** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📁 `css` |

</details>

---

Let me check the contents of both CSS directories to understand the styling structure.

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/public/wp-content/themes/hello-elementor-child/assets/css • **2** results</summary>
        
| Name |

</details>

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory app/public/wp-content/themes/hello-elementor-child/css • **3** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `base-styles.css` |
| 📄 `style-guide.md` |
| 📄 `variables.css` |

</details>

---

Based on our previous conversation and the current directory structure, here's a summary of the Hello Elementor child theme's organization:

1. Root Theme Files:
   - `functions.php`: Theme functionality and Elementor customizations
   - `style.css`: Main theme stylesheet with theme metadata
   - `README.md`: Theme documentation
   - `style-guide.md`: Design system documentation
   - `custom.css`: Custom styles

2. CSS Structure:
   - `/assets/css/`:
     - `variables.css`: CSS custom properties (colors, typography, spacing)
     - `main.css`: Main stylesheet with organized styling rules
   - `/css/`:
     - `base-styles.css`: Base styling rules
     - `variables.css`: Another copy of CSS variables
     - `style-guide.md`: Additional styling documentation

The theme appears to be well-organized with a clear separation of concerns and documentation. Would you like me to examine any specific aspect of the theme in more detail?
