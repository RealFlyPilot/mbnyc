# Installing Magic MCP from GitHub (2025-04-03 20:57:45)

_**User**_

Install this @https://github.com/21st-dev/magic-mcp 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you install the 21st.dev Magic MCP. Let's first check if we have Node.js installed.

---

```bash
node -v
```

```
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc % node -v
v23.5.0
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc %
```

---

Great! You have Node.js v23.5.0 installed. Let's install the 21st.dev Magic MCP using their CLI tool. The recommended method is using the CLI installation. 

Let's first check which IDE you're using to determine the appropriate client parameter.

---

```bash
echo $TERM_PROGRAM
```

```
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc % echo $TERM_PROGRAM
vscode
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc %
```

---

I see you're using VSCode. According to the documentation, you'll need to use Cline as the client for VSCode integration.

Now, let's install the Magic MCP. To do this, you'll need to generate an API key from the 21st.dev Magic Console first. Since I don't have your API key, I'll show you the command to run once you have your key:

---

Command contains newline characters.

---

Let me fix that and provide the installation instructions:

---

```bash
echo "To install Magic MCP, run: npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install cline --api-key YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc % echo "To install Magic MCP, run: npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install cline -
-api-key YOUR_API_KEY"             echo "To install Magic MCP, run: npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install cline -
-api-key YOUR_API_KEY"
To install Magic MCP, run: npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install cline --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc %
```

---

You'll need to get an API key from the 21st.dev Magic Console to complete the installation. Here's how to set it up:

1. Visit the 21st.dev Magic Console to generate your API key
2. Run the installation command with your API key:
   ```
   npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install cline --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
   ```

If you prefer to set up manually, you can create or edit the MCP config file for your IDE. For VSCode with Cline, the config file should be at `~/.cline/mcp_config.json`. Let's check if this directory exists:

---

```bash
ls -la ~/.cline 2>/dev/null || echo "~/.cline directory does not exist"
```

```
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc % ls -la ~/.cline 2>/dev/null || echo "~/.cline directory does not exist"
~/.cline directory does not exist
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc %
```

---

The `~/.cline` directory doesn't exist yet. This is expected if you haven't set up Cline before. If you're using Cursor IDE instead, let's check if you have the Cursor config directory:

---

```bash
ls -la ~/.cursor 2>/dev/null || echo "~/.cursor directory does not exist"
```

```
<ev/null || echo "~/.cursor directory does not exist"
total 16
drwxr-xr-x@  5 mlovascio  staff   160 Apr  2 12:06 .
drwxr-x---+ 34 mlovascio  staff  1088 Apr  3 20:57 ..
-rw-r--r--@  1 mlovascio  staff   798 Mar 20 15:29 argv.json
drwxr-xr-x@ 40 mlovascio  staff  1280 Apr  3 17:41 extensions
-rw-r--r--@  1 mlovascio  staff  1059 Apr  2 16:12 mcp.json
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc %
```

---

Great! I see you have the Cursor IDE installed with the `~/.cursor` directory and an existing `mcp.json` file. Since you're using Cursor, we should use that for the installation. Let's look at the existing MCP configuration:

---

```bash
cat ~/.cursor/mcp.json
```

```
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase_composio": {
      "url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/supabase/abandoned-wailing-tailor-iOwzCD"
    },
    "googletasks_composio": {
      "url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/googletasks/abandoned-wailing-tailor-iOwzCD"
    },
    "gmail_composio": {
      "url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/gmail/abandoned-wailing-tailor-iOwzCD"
    },
    "slack_composio": {
      "url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/slack/abandoned-wailing-tailor-iOwzCD"
    },
    "zendesk_composio": {
      "url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/zendesk/abandoned-wailing-tailor-iOwzCD"
    },
    "hubspot_composio": {
      "url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/hubspot/abandoned-wailing-tailor-iOwzCD"
    },
    "github_composio": {
      "url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/github/abandoned-wailing-tailor-iOwzCD"
    },
    "googlesheets_composio": {
      "url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/googlesheets/abandoned-wailing-tailor-iOwzCD"
    },
    "googledrive_composio": {
      "url": "https://mcp.composio.dev/googledrive/abandoned-wailing-tailor-iOwzCD"
    }
  }
}%


```

---

Perfect! Now I can see your existing MCP configuration. Since you're using Cursor IDE, let's install the 21st.dev Magic MCP for Cursor. You have two options:

### Option 1: Use the CLI (Recommended)
Run this command with your API key from 21st.dev Magic Console:
```
npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install cursor --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Option 2: Update your MCP config manually
You can add the Magic MCP configuration to your existing `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file. Let's create a backup of your current config first:

---

```bash
cp ~/.cursor/mcp.json ~/.cursor/mcp.json.backup
```

```
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc % 

```

---

Now let's install the Magic MCP using the CLI method, which is the recommended approach. Since you need an API key from 21st.dev, I'll guide you through the process:

1. First, you need to visit the 21st.dev Magic Console website to generate your API key
2. Once you have your API key, run the following command (replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual key):

---

```bash
echo "After getting your API key from 21st.dev, run: npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install cursor --api-key YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```
<ev/cli@latest install cursor --api-key YOUR_API_KEY"
After getting your API key from 21st.dev, run: npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install cursor --api-key YOUR_API_KE
Y
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc %
```

---

I can also show you how to manually update your MCP configuration if you prefer. Here's what you need to add to your existing `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file:

---

Command contains newline characters.

---

Let me provide the manual configuration instructions more clearly:

---

```bash
echo "To manually configure Magic MCP, you'll need to add the @21st-dev/magic entry to your ~/.cursor/mcp.json file."
```

```
<st-dev/magic entry to your ~/.cursor/mcp.json file."
To manually configure Magic MCP, you'll need to add the @21st-dev/magic entry to your ~/.cursor/mcp.json fil
e.
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc %
```

---

Here's how to complete the installation of 21st.dev Magic MCP:

### Summary of Installation Options:

1. **CLI Installation (Recommended)**:
   After obtaining your API key from 21st.dev Magic Console, run:
   ```
   npx @21st-dev/cli@latest install cursor --api-key YOUR_API_KEY
   ```
   This automatically configures everything for you.

2. **Manual Configuration**:
   If you prefer to set up manually, edit your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file and add the `@21st-dev/magic` entry to the `mcpServers` object:
   ```json
   "@21st-dev/magic": {
     "command": "npx",
     "args": ["-y", "@21st-dev/magic@latest", "API_KEY=\"YOUR_API_KEY\""]
   }
   ```
   (Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key)

### Using Magic MCP:

Once installed, you can start using Magic MCP in your projects by:
1. In your AI Agent's chat, type `/ui` followed by a description of the component you need
2. For example: `/ui create a modern navigation bar with responsive design`
3. The Magic component will be generated and added to your project

### Features Available:
- AI-powered UI component generation from natural language descriptions
- Modern component library access
- TypeScript support
- SVGL integration for professional brand assets and logos
- Real-time component previews

Remember to restart Cursor after installation to ensure Magic MCP is properly loaded.

You may need to restart Cursor to see the Magic MCP server.
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc %
```

---

The installation was successful! The 21st.dev Magic MCP has been configured for Cursor.

To complete the setup:
1. Restart Cursor to load the Magic MCP server
2. You can now use Magic MCP by typing `/ui` in your AI chat followed by a description of the component you want to create

For example, you can try commands like:
- `/ui create a responsive navigation bar with logo and menu items`
- `/ui build a contact form with name, email, and message fields`
- `/ui design a product card with image, title, price and add to cart button`

Remember that Magic MCP allows you to generate UI components based on natural language descriptions and integrates with your existing project structure.

I found the firecrawl MCP package. It's called `firecrawl-mcp` and it's an MCP server for FireCrawl web scraping integration. Let's install it following a similar approach as we did for the 21st.dev Magic MCP.

First, let's check if there's any additional information about the package:

---

```bash
npm view firecrawl-mcp

```
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc % npm view firecrawl-mcp

Now I'll check if we need an API key for FireCrawl:

---

```bash
npx firecrawl-mcp --help 2>&1 || echo "Need to install the package first"
```

```
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc % npx firecrawl-mcp --help 2>&1 || echo "Need to install the package first"
                                   npx firecrawl-mcp --help 2>&1 || echo "Need to install the package first"
 
Need to install the following packages:
firecrawl-mcp@1.7.2

---

I see that the FireCrawl MCP requires an API key, which should be set in the `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` environment variable. Let's install the FireCrawl MCP for Cursor following a similar approach to what we did for the 21st.dev Magic MCP.

Since you'll need an API key from FireCrawl, let's first check how to manually add the FireCrawl MCP configuration to your Cursor MCP config file:

---

```bash
cat ~/.cursor/mcp.json
```

```

      ]
    }
  }
}%


```

I see that the 21st.dev Magic MCP is now correctly added to your configuration. Now let's set up the FireCrawl MCP.

To install the FireCrawl MCP, you'll need to:

1. Obtain a FireCrawl API key from their service
2. Update your Cursor MCP configuration file to include the FireCrawl MCP server

Let's update your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file to add the FireCrawl MCP configuration:

The FireCrawl MCP has been added to your Cursor MCP configuration file. However, you'll need to replace `YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` with your actual FireCrawl API key.

To get a FireCrawl API key, you'll need to:
1. Sign up for a FireCrawl account at their official website
2. Generate an API key from your account dashboard
3. Replace the placeholder in the configuration with your actual API key

Once you have your FireCrawl API key, let's update the configuration file:

---

```bash
echo "Replace 'YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY' with your actual FireCrawl API key in ~/.cursor/mcp.json"
```

```
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc % echo "Replace 'YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY' with your actual FireCrawl API key
 in ~/.cursor/mcp.json"            echo "Replace 'YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY' with your actual FireCrawl API key
 in ~/.cursor/mcp.json"
Replace 'YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY' with your actual FireCrawl API key in ~/.cursor/mcp.json
mlovascio@Mikes-Mac-Studio mbnyc %
```

The FireCrawl MCP has been added to your Cursor configuration. Here's a summary of what you need to do to complete the setup:

1. **Get a FireCrawl API Key**:
   - Sign up for a FireCrawl account
   - Generate an API key from your account dashboard

2. **Update Your Configuration**:
   - Edit the `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file
   - Replace `YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` with your actual FireCrawl API key
   - Save the file

3. **Restart Cursor**:
   - Restart Cursor IDE to load the updated MCP configuration

Once you've completed these steps, the FireCrawl MCP will be available in your Cursor IDE. You can then use its web scraping, content extraction, and other features.

If you get your FireCrawl API key, you can either:
1. Manually update the configuration file as described above, or
2. Let me know the API key, and I can update the configuration file for you

Would you like me to provide more information about using FireCrawl features once it's installed?

I'll update your configuration with the FireCrawl API key you provided.

---

```diff
          "-y",
          "firecrawl-mcp@latest",
-         "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"YOUR_FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\""
+         "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"fc-88458342d2474827a53fcd5ede0c17f1\""
        ]
      }
```

---

FireCrawl MCP has been successfully configured with your API key. The configuration file has been updated.

To complete the setup:

1. Restart Cursor IDE to load the updated MCP configuration with the FireCrawl integration

Once restarted, you'll be able to use FireCrawl's web scraping and content extraction features in your projects. The FireCrawl MCP provides capabilities for:

- Web scraping
- Batch processing
- Structured data extraction
- LLM-powered content analysis

You can now use both the 21st.dev Magic MCP for UI component generation and the FireCrawl MCP for web scraping in your Cursor IDE.

Use the firecrawl mcp to research best practices for creating a GitHub repo out of a site that is currently hosted on WPEngine and being developed on LocalWP. Help me set up a best practices repo and publish it privately to RealFlyPilot/mbnyc

Note: I don't know if i opened this project at the right level in the WP folder structure or if i should've opened it inside the wp-content folder - that's the kind of thing I need you to answer. Document your findings and our choices etc in the readme you create

I'll use firecrawl to research best practices for WordPress Git workflows with WPEngine and LocalWP, then help set up your repository structure.

---

```bash
npx firecrawl-mcp scrape "wordpress git workflow best practices wpengine localwp"
```

```
Error: FIRECRAWL_API_KEY environment variable is required when using the cloud s
ervice

Let me try a different approach to use the firecrawl MCP:
